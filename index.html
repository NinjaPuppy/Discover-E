Reserved and honorable, Malik wouldn’t be noticed by a bystander in a Nairobi street&#8212;except perhaps to comment on his carefully sculpted combover. But beneath that unprepossessing exterior lies a warm heart and a secret passion.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;But just as Malik is getting up the nerve to invite Rose to the Nairobi Hunt Club Ball (the premier social occasion of the Kenyan calendar), who should pop up but his nemesis from his school days. The jokester Harry Khan, good-looking in a flashy way and quick of foot, has also become enraptured with the object of Malik’s affection.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;So begins the competition cooked up by fellow members of the Asadi club: whoever can identify the most species of birds in one week’s time gets the privilege of asking Ms. Mbikwa to the ball. Set against the lush Kenyan landscape rich with wildlife and political intrigue, this irresistible novel is winning fans worldwide.</div>

I’m an expert on fear now. I think I’ve felt every strong feeling there is: love, hate, jealousy, rage. But fear’s the greatest of them all. Nothing reaches inside and grabs you by the guts the way fear does. Nothing else possesses you like that. It’s a kind of illness, a fever, that takes you over.”<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Ellie and her friends return from a camping trip to find their country at war. Learning together, they fight back&#8212;battling fear, rage, and the invading army that has stolen their land, seized their homes, taken their families, and destroyed their future. Continuing the story begun in <em>Tomorrow When the War Began</em> and <em>The Dead of Night</em>, John Marsden paints a shockingly realistic portrait of teenagers who take great risks to defend what is theirs.</div>

It’s an unusual and at times unbearable existence, but Chaos soon discovers that his post-nuclear reality may have no connection to the truth. So he takes to the road with a girl named Melinda in order to find answers. As the pair travels through the United States they find that, while each town has been affected differently by the mysterious source of the apocalypse, none of the people they meet can fill in their incomplete memories or answer their questions. Gradually, figures from Chaos’s past, including some who appear only under the influence of intravenously administered drugs, make Chaos remember some of his forgotten life as a man named Moon.</div>

		<div class="popup_author">Jon McGregor</div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">Risky in conception, hip and yet soulful, this is a prose poem of a novel&#8212;intense, lyrical, and highly evocative&#8212;with a mystery at its center, which keeps the reader in suspense until the final page. In a tour de force that could be described as Altmanesque, we are invited into the private lives of the residents of a quiet urban street in England over the course of a single day. In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. The tranquillity of the street is shattered at day’s end when a terrible accident occurs.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;This tragedy and an utterly surprising twist provide the momentum for the book. But it is the author’s exquisite rendering of the ordinary, the everyday, that gives this novel its freshness, its sense of beauty, wonder, and hope. Rarely does a writer appear with so much music and poetry&#8212;so much vision&#8212;that he can make the world seem new.</div>

The name she gives her daughter, Imani, is a sign of her determination and fundamental trust: Imani means faith. “Mama say I’m grown now because I got Imani. She say Imani all mine. I know she all mine, and I like it just like that, not having to share my baby with no one.” Narrated in Tasha’s street-smart and lyrical voice, <em>Imani All Mine</em> tracks Tasha’s progress as she navigates her journey to adulthood in an increasingly violent world.</div>

Unlike Joey-Mick, Maggie doesn’t play baseball&#8212;but at almost ten years old, she is a dyed-in-the-wool fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Maggie can recite all the players’ statistics and understands the subtleties of the game. Unfortunately, Jim Maine is a Giants fan, but it’s Jim who teaches Maggie the fine art of scoring a baseball game. Not only can she revisit every play of every inning, but by keeping score she feels she’s more than just a fan: she’s helping her team.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Jim is drafted into the army and sent to Korea, and although Maggie writes to him often, his silence is just one of a string of disappointments&#8212;being a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in the early 1950s meant season after season of near misses and year after year of dashed hopes. But Maggie goes on trying to help the Dodgers, and when she finds out that Jim needs help, too, she’s determined to provide it. Against a background of major league baseball and the Korean War on the home front, Maggie looks for, and finds, a way to make a difference.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Even those readers who think they don’t care about baseball will be drawn into the world of the true and ardent fan. Linda Sue Park’s captivating story will, of course, delight those who are already keeping score.</div>

The Summer of Passion, to be exact, when Jory Michaels plans to explore all the possibilities of the future&#8212;and, with any luck, score a boyfriend in the process. But Jory has a problem. A big problem. A curvy, honking, bumpy, problem in the form of her Super Schnozz, the one thing standing between Jory and happiness. And now, with the Summer of Passion stretched before her like an open road, she’s determined for Super Schnozz to disappear. Jory takes a job delivering wedding cakes to save up for a nose job at the end of the summer; she even keeps a book filled with magazine cutouts of perfect noses to show the doctor. But nothing is ever easy for accident-prone Jory&#8212;and before she knows it, her Summer of Passion falls apart faster than the delivery van she crashes. In her hilarious and heartbreaking debut novel, Sydney Salter delivers a story about broadening your horizons, accepting yourself, and finding love right under your nose.</div>

		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">Set on a Southern army base in the 1930s, <em>Reflections in a Golden Eye</em> tells the story of Captain Penderton, a bisexual whose life is upset by the arrival of Major Langdon, a charming womanizer who has an affair with Penderton’s tempestuous and flirtatious wife, Leonora. Upon the novel’s publication in 1941, reviewers were unsure of what to make of its relatively scandalous subject matter. A critic for Time Magazine wrote, “In almost any hands, such material would yield a rank fruitcake of mere arty melodrama. But Carson McCullers tells her tale with simplicity, insight, and a rare gift of phrase.” Written during a time when McCullers’s own marriage to Reeves was on the brink of collapse, her second novel deals with her trademark themes of alienation and unfulfilled loves.</div>

		<div class="popup_author">John Dos Passos</div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">With his U.S.A. trilogy, comprising THE 42nd PARALLEL, 1919, and THE BIG MONEY, John Dos Passos is said by many to have written the great American novel. While Fitzgerald and Hemingway were cultivating what Edmund Wilson once called their “own little corners,” John Dos Passos was taking on the world. Counted as one of the best novels of the twentieth century by the Modern Library and by some of the finest writers working today, U.S.A. is a grand, kaleidoscopic portrait of a nation, buzzing with history and life on every page.The trilogy opens with THE 42nd PARALLEL, where we find a young country at the dawn of the twentieth century. Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold. Mac, Janey, Eleanor, Ward, and Charley are caught on the storm track of this parallel and blown New Yorkward. As their lives cross and double back again, the likes of Eugene Debs, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Carnegie make cameo appearances.</div>

There, in the lovely city of Isfahan, he meets the enchanting and spirited Shirin, an Iranian schoolgirl of seventeen. They fall desperately in love, marry in secret, and are forced into hiding. Shirin not only gives John happiness beyond anything he could have dreamed, she gives him her country’s terrible history, its beauty and bitterness, its poetry and religious fanaticism. As the old world disintegrates in revolution and terror, John and Shirin are brutally separated. From the corrupt court of the shah to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, in an enduring human quest as old as THE ODYSSEY, John stumbles through history to find his wife. James Buchan has lived in Iran and knows its people and its culture as few outsiders do. THE PERSIAN BRIDE is unflinching in its vision of twentieth-century chaos and deeply romantic in its marvelous love story. Lyrical and reflective in turn, this is a brilliant and beautiful novel.</div>

		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">Set in the stunning landscape of North Wales just after D-Day, Peter Ho Davies’s profoundly moving first novel traces the intersection of disparate lives in wartime. When a POW camp is established near her village, seventeen-year-old barmaid Esther Evans finds herself strangely drawn to the camp and its forlorn captives. She is exploring the camp boundary when the astonishing occurs: Karsten, a young German corporal, calls out to her from behind the fence. From that moment on, the two foster a secret relationship that will ultimately put them both at risk. Meanwhile, another foreigner, the German-Jewish interrogator Rotherham, travels to Wales to investigate Britain's most notorious Nazi prisoner, Rudolf Hess. In this richly drawn and thought-provoking work, all will come to question where they belong and where their loyalties lie.</div>

		<div class="popup_description">The first book in Philip K. Dick’s final trilogy (followed by <em>The Divine Invasion</em> and <em>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</em>), <em>VALIS</em> encapsulates many of the themes that Dick was obsessed with over the course of his career. A disorienting and bleakly funny novel, <em>VALIS</em> (which stands for Vast Active Living Intelligence System) is about a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat (who just might also be known as Philip Dick); the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity; and reality as revealed through a pink laser. <em>VALIS</em> is a theological detective story, in which God is both a missing person and the perpetrator of the ultimate crime. Taking place in the same universe as Dick’s soon-to-be-published <em>Exegesis</em>, <em>VALIS</em> is a dense novel, but one that is absolutely essential to understanding the author’s off-kilter worldview. Much like Dick himself, the reader is left wondering what is real, what is fiction, and what the price is for divine inspiration.</div>

As the novel begins, fourteen-year-old Marie Antoinette is traveling from Austria to France to meet her fiancé, the mild, abstracted Louis. He will become the sixteenth Louis to reign in France, and Antoinette will be his queen, hemmed in by towering hairdos, the xenophobic suspicion of her subjects, the misogyny of her detractors, the larger-than-life figures of Mirabeau, Du Barry, Robespierre, and the manifold twists and turns of the palace she calls home.The novel moves from room to room, from garden to fountain, occasionally breaking into playlets in which we glimpse characters struggling to mind their step in the great ballroom of the world. Driving our tour is the relentless engine of time, that friend to youth, for whom anything is possible. Antoinette gives birth to four children, two of whom will outlive her; she falls in love; she dies at the guillotine. A meditation on time and the soul’s true journey within it, Versailles is at once wittily entertaining and astonishingly wise.</div>

		<div class="popup_description">“With a mood akin to <em>Wuthering Heights</em>&#8212;and indeed the spirit of Emily Bronte” (<em>Irish Times</em>), Edna O’Brien’s critically acclaimed novel <em>Wild Decembers</em> charts the quick but sure demise of relations between “the warring sons of warring sons.” <br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Here in the countryside of western Ireland, "ancient feuds, romantic passions, and misguided ideas of fidelity blend together in .&#160;.&#160;. [a] heartbreaking story” (<em>Wall Street Journal</em>) leavened by the human comedy of which O’Brien rarely loses sight. A sister, a brother, and a stranger converge in a classic triangle, proceeding inevitably “toward a climax that is Irish to the quick, violent and sad and, in a strange way, beautiful. Just like the novel itself” (<em>Washington Post</em>).<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<em>Wild Decembers</em> is a triumphant work from a writer who wears well the mantle of her Irish forebears and yet who, with each new novel, breaks new ground all her own. In this, her latest, "readers could not ask for a more profoundly satisfying book” (<em>Boston Herald</em>).</div>

		<div class="popup_author">Molly Gloss</div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">In her highly original new novel, Molly Gloss delivers a rare blend of “heady cerebral satisfactions, gorgeous prose, and page-turning adventure” (Karen Joy Fowler). Set among lava sinkholes and logging camps at the fringe of the Northwest frontier in the early 1900s, <em>Wild Life</em> charts the life&#8212;both real and imagined&#8212;of the free-thinking, cigar-smoking, trouser-wearing Charlotte Bridger Drummond, who pens popular women’s adventure stories. One day, when a little girl gets lost in the woods, Charlotte anxiously joins the search and embarks on an adventure all her own. With great assurance and skill, Molly Gloss quickly transforms what at first seems to be pitch-perfect historical fiction into a kind of wild and woolly mystery story, as Charlotte herself becomes lost in the dark and tangled woods and falls into the company of an elusive band of mountain giants. Putting a surprising and revitalizing feminist spin on the classic legend of Tarzan and other wild-man sagas, Gloss takes us from the wilds of the western frontier to the wilds of the human heart. “Never has there been a more authentic, persuasive, or moving evocation of this elusive legend: Wild Life is a masterpiece” (<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>).</div>

As a child Innis went with his parents to live in Boston. After his father was killed in a car accident, Innis was raised by his mother, a woman with a weakness for men and drink. When Innis gets into trouble over a series of car thefts, he is deported back to Canada, a fate worse than prison, in his eyes. Innis ends up living with his Uncle Starr amidst the harshly beautiful landscape that has shaped his family and that both absorbs and challenges him. He takes refuge in the wild, dense woods, where he devises a plan to grow marijuana. This venture relieves his loneliness and gives him something to care for, a secret of his own. Then Claire, an attractive former flight attendant nearing 40, enters the Starr household. So begins an entanglement that leads to suspicion, jealousy, and ultimately to violence.</div>

Note: we are changing not airplanes here but planes of existence. Le Guin’s humorous premise frames a series of travel accounts by the tourist-narrator who has mastered Sitka Dulip’s Method. The fanciful descriptions of bizarre societies and cultures sometimes mirror&#8212;and satirize&#8212;our own, sometimes open puzzling doors into the alien.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;In these delightful, wry short stories, Le Guin combines <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>, Borge’s fictions, and Saint-Exupery’s <em>The Little Prince</em> to treat war, tyranny, the middle class, folly, Disney, mortality and immortality, dreams, art, technology, and the meaning&#8212;and the mystery&#8212;of being human.</div>

Evoking the claustrophobia of small-town life, Anna’s first passionate love affair with a troubled boy who works as a groom and trainer at a horse track, and her mother’s endless stream of suitors and a failed marriage, the novel races toward a chilling conclusion when Anna is betrayed by the two most important figures in her young life.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Not since Alice McDermott’s <em>That Night</em> has there been such a telling portrait of first love. And not since Mona Simpson’s <em>Anywhere But Here</em> have we witnessed the destructive, seductive nature of a mother who insists on competing with her children. An unforgettable tale of the power and vulnerability of sex and family, history and the past, <em>House Under Snow</em> is a lyrical and brilliant fictional debut.</div>

Yanan, its headstrong heroine, lived twenty thousand years ago near Woman Lake in central Siberia among places you will not find on any modern map. Yanan, only thirteen when her story begins, is passionate and courageous, and her companions&#8212;hunters of deer, gatherers of roots and twigs, shamans, babies at the breast&#8212;are all, like her, bound to the harsh realities of hunger, cold, death by violence or childbirth, and the cycles of love and jealousy, of marriage and kinship. As Yanan recounts the terrible adventures of her brief life she departs, from time to time, on spirit journeys that evoke the lives of animals with extraordinary intimacy, for Yanan’s fate is like ours but conceived in different terms.</div>

Her small-town characters are as appealingly offbeat and brushed with grace as any found in Alice Hoffman's or Anne Tyler's novels.”&#8212;<em>Glamour</em>&nbsp;<br/><br/>“Jane Hamilton's novel is authentically Dickensian .&#160;.&#160;. The real achievement of this first novel is not so much the blackness as the suggestion of resilience. At the end, Ruth begins to put together her shattered body, spirit and life. Her words are awkward, as they have been all along, but suddenly and unexpectedly they shine.”&#8212;<em>Los Angeles Times</em>&nbsp;<br/><br/>

		<div class="popup_author">Alexandra Marshall</div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">“Marshall has the essential novelist’s gift, the creation of vivid characters,” said the <em>New York Times</em>.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;In her new novel, she has again created a cast both real and vibrant. At sixty-three, Judge Gregory Brennan is on the brink of retirement. With his youngest daughter headed for college, he envisions traveling abroad, basking in a repose that his demanding career has not allowed, with his wife, Audrey, at his side. But Audrey has other ambitions. At forty-nine, she sees the mythic empty nest as an opportunity to explore her own potential&#8212;as a medical student. When Audrey reveals her plans, Gregory is overwhelmed, and he emotionally retreats, causing a rift that neither one of them ever anticipated. Marshall has been praised for her insight into the complexities of modern marriage, capturing it as “an institution about competing needs and shifting wants” (<em>Baltimore Sun</em>).<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;In <em>The Court of Common Pleas</em>, marriage is not unlike the general trial court where Gregory presides. But the ruling in Gregory and Audrey’s own case remains to be seen. Can their disparate life plans be mediated and their differences reconciled? Marshall offers a nuanced portrait of a marriage in the throes of a midlife crisis and reveals, with an encompassing kindness, the tenderness, frustration, bewilderment, and ultimately the joy of a marriage willed to endure.</div>

		<div class="popup_author">Howard Mosher</div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">The rugged and mysterious mountains of Kingdom County are the setting for Howard Frank Mosher’s brilliant new autobiographical novel, <em>The Fall of the Year</em>. Like Mosher’s acclaimed earlier novels, <em>The Fall of the Year</em> celebrates the fiercely independent people of Kingdom Common, including such memorable new characters as Foster Boy Dufresne, the local bottle picker and metaphysical savant; the incomparably strange clairvoyant and matchmaker, Louvia the Fortuneteller; Dr. Sam E. Rong, a wayfaring Chinese herbalist and connoisseur of human nature; the itinerant vaudevillian mind reader, Mr. Moriarity Mentality, who uses his unusual powers to teach the town fathers a lesson they will never forget; and the daredevil tomboy, Molly Murphy, who risks her life twice in a single day to fulfill her dream of running away with the Last Railway Extravaganza and Greatest Little Show on Earth. At the heart of The Fall of the Year are Kingdom County’s baseball-playing, trout-fishing “unorthodox priest,” Father George Lecoeur, his adopted son and protegé, Frank Bennett, and two interlocking love stories unlike any others in contemporary fiction.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Written in Howard Frank Mosher’s distinctively wry and ironical voice, with the straight-ahead narrative action that characterizes all his fiction, <em>The Fall of the Year</em> is a celebration of love in all its forms, from friendship to the most passionate romance, in a place where family, community, vocation, and the natural world still matter profoundly.</div>

		<div class="popup_description">Eleanor Cahn is a professor of literature, the wife of a preeminent cardiac surgeon, and a devoted mother. But on a trip to Paris to present a paper on Anna Karenina, Eleanor re-connects with Stephen&#8212;a childhood friend with whom she has had a complicated relationship&#8212;that forces her to realize that she has suppressed her passionate self for years. As the novel unfolds, we learn of her hidden erotic past: with alluring, elusive Stephen; with ethereal William, her high school boyfriend; with married, egotistical Adam, the painter who initiated her into the intimacies of the “life room,” where the artist’s model sometimes becomes muse; and with loyal, steady Michael, her husband.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;On her return to New York, Eleanor and Stephen’s charged attraction takes on a life of its own and threatens to destroy everything she has. Jill Bialosky has created a fresh, piercingly real heroine who struggles with the spiritual questions and dilemmas of our time and, like Tolstoy’s immortal Anna Karenina, must choose between desire and responsibility.</div>

Along the way True and Ti encounter Daniel Boone and his six-foot-two spinster daughter, Flame Danielle; fight and trick a renegade army out to stop Lewis’s expedition; invent baseball with the Nez Perce; hold a high-stakes rodeo with Sacagawea’s Shoshone relatives; and outwit True’s lifelong adversary, the Gentleman from Vermont, a.k.a. the devil himself. And when a beautiful and mysterious Blackfoot girl named Yellow Sage Flower Who Tells Wise Stories enters the tale, things start to get really interesting. <em>The True Account</em>, which Lawrence Millman calls “part riotous adventure, part book of wonders, and part historical travesty,” is the hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking story of a man “whose imagination is unfettered by either convention or fact, whose hopefulness and good nature yield to no force, and whose ways and stays rank second to none in the history of the world.”</div>

		<hr/>
		<div class="popup_description">This enormously entertaining yet serious novel tells a story of African-American women struggling against all odds to express what lies deepest in their hearts.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Like Michael Chabon’s <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em> or E. L. Doctorow’s <em>Ragtime</em>, it ranges freely through time, fact, and fiction to weave an enthralling story about history and art and their place in the lives of three women. “My mother believed in the power of movies and the people in them to change a life, to change her life.” So explains Tamara, daughter of Angela, granddaughter of Mildred&#8212;the three women whose lives are portrayed in stunning detail in this ambitious novel spanning three generations of one family.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1970 is not a place a smart black girl wants to linger. For Angela, twenty years old and beautiful, the stifling conformity is unbearable. She heads to Los Angeles just as blaxploitation movies are pouring money into the studios and lands a few bit parts before an unplanned pregnancy derails her plans for stardom. For Mildred, movies have always been a blessed diversion in a life marked by the legacy of the 1921 Tulsa race riots. But after Angela leaves Tulsa following a bitter fight, the distance between them grows into a breach that remains for years. It falls to Tamara, a budding documentarian&#8212;raised in LA by Angela as though they have no family, no history&#8212;to help mother and grandmother confront all that has been silenced and left unsaid in their lives. A bold, beautifully written, and deeply involving novel, <em>Third Girl from the Left</em> deftly examines the pull of the movies, the power of desire, and the bonds of family in a quintessentially American story.</div>

		<div class="popup_description"><em>To Feel Stuff</em> is the story of Elodie Harrington, medical anomaly. Elodie is a sufferer of mysterious and frequent illnesses- so frequent, in fact, that her poor health forces her to live in the Brown University infirmary. In the winter of her junior year, while recovering from a bout of tuberculosis, two major events occur in Elodie’s isolated life.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;First, big-man-on-campus Chess Hunter enters the infirmary after having his knees bashed in during an a cappella performance, and Elodie begins an intense romance with him. Secondly, she begins to see a ghost. Believing that her barrage of illnesses has produced a supernatural change in her&#8212;specifically an ability to see the dead&#8212;Elodie turns to Dr. Kirschling to help her prove the phenomenon. Kirschling, a Brown medical school professor and practicing doctor, sees potential in Elodie. Convinced he’ll be a hero within his profession if he can crack the cause behind her bizarre afflictions, Kirschling makes a deal with his patient. If she’ll give him access to her life and let him write an article about her, then he’ll keep the University from kicking her out of school. What Kirchling hasn’t prepared himself for is the possibility that Elodie might be right, that she’s really going through what he starts to refer to as “psychic puberty.”</div>

		<div class="popup_description">A vivid portrait of a young man’s coming of age in an America that is almost gone. The book begins on the eighth birthday of Ethan “E.A.” Allen in the remote village of Kingdom Common, Vermont. Noted for its fervent, if unrequited, devotion to the Boston Red Sox, the village sports a replica of Fenway Park’s Green Monster on top of the local baseball bat factory.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Here, in a region that lags decades behind the rest of New England, E.A. lives with his honky-tonk mother, Gypsy Lee, and the acid-tongued Gran, wheelchair-bound since the Sox’s heart-wrenching playoff loss to the Yankees in 1978. Homeschooled, fatherless, and living on the wrong side of the tracks, E.A. is an outcast in his own town. Haunted by a dark mystery in his family’s past, he has only one close friend to talk it over with, a statue of his namesake on the village green.<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;Into the world of the Allen family comes a drifter named Teddy, who is determined to do one decent thing in his life by teaching E.A. everything he knows about baseball. As E.A. grows up and learns the secrets of the game, we get to know Kingdom Common and its flinty, colorful people. We also meet the incomparable manager of the Red Sox, the Legendary Spence, "the winningest big-league manager never to win a World Series,” and his macaw, Curse of the Bambino. When the Sox’s new owner vows to move the team to Hollywood if they lose the Series again, Spence, his pitching corps decimated by injuries, has to take a chance on a young nobody from Vermont.</div>
